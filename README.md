The methodology used is where the Pr(>|t|) value in the summary above represents the probability that each contribution may contribute a random amount of variance to the linear model.

Using the data set provided and after running a multi linear regression model, of the variables utilized in this model it is unlikely that the vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to provided random amounts of variance to the linear model as their contributions seem to be more significant, especially when compared to other variables.  These two variables, length of vehicle and ground clearance seem to have a significant impact on miles per gallon.
